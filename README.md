# JavaScript Quiz

An application created as a quiz for JavaScript

## Description

This application servers as a quiz about JavaScript. When the user starts the quiz, the timer begins. The user answers the questions as quickly as possible. Ten seconds are subtracted for every incorrect answer. At the end of the quiz, the time left gets saved as the score in local storage, along with the user's initials that they input. A highscore page is created from the scores in local storage and can be erased by the user clicking a button. This project makes use of DOM traversal and web APIs including the creation of HTML elements with JavaScript, storing elements in local storage with JSON, loading stored values into the innerHTML, and more. The use of these methods and functionality helped to improve understanding of JavaScript and web API capabilities.
